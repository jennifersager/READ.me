I began programming Fall 2020. I am currently most familiar with Python. I am very proud of the work that I have completed through my classes so far. 
I am continuing to take more classes and expand my knowledge in this field. 
I am working working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Wayne State University.
My expected graduation is Fall 2023.
I look forward to building my profile and creating more projects to share.
