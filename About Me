I began programming Fall 2020, so my expereince is still quite low. I am currently most familiar with Python. I am very proud of the work that I have completed through my classes so far. I am continuing to take more classes and expand my knowledge in this field. I am working working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Wayne State University.
I am going to be honest, this site confused me when I first created my account. Since then I have watched tutorials, done research, and have figured a lot of it out on my own. Although I created this account for academic purposes, I look forward to building my profile and creating more work to share.
